## User Question:

How would you implement the retry logic with tenacity?

## GitHub Copilot Answer:

Okay, here's how you can implement retry logic using the `tenacity` library for your `_get_offer` method.

First, you'll need to install `tenacity`:
```bash
pip install tenacity
```

Then, you can use its decorators to add retry behavior.

Here's the modified `app/api/verbynDich.py`:

```python
import aiohttp
from pydantic import PrivateAttr
from app.schemas import (
    ProviderEnum,
    NetworkRequestData,
    VerbynDichRequestData,
    VerbynDichQueryParams,
    BaseProvider
)
from app.config import get_settings
from typing import Dict, List, Any
# import requests # No longer needed if fully switched to aiohttp
import logging
import asyncio
from tenacity import ( # Import tenacity
    retry,
    stop_after_attempt,
    wait_exponential,
    retry_if_exception_type,
    before_sleep_log
)

        return raw_offer
```

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

1.  **Import `tenacity`**: Added necessary imports from the `tenacity` library.
2.  **`@retry` Decorator**:
    *   The `_get_offer` method is now decorated with `@retry`.
    *   `stop=stop_after_attempt(3)`: The request will be attempted a maximum of 3 times (1 initial try + 2 retries).
    *   `wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=1, max=10)`:
        *   This tells `tenacity` to wait exponentially between retries.
        *   `multiplier=1`: The wait time will be `2^previous_attempt_number * 1` seconds. So, after the first failure, it waits `1*2^0 = 1s`, then `1*2^1 = 2s`, then `1*2^2 = 4s`.
        *   `min=1`: Minimum wait time is 1 second.
        *   `max=10`: Maximum wait time is 10 seconds.
    *   `retry=retry_if_exception_type(aiohttp.ClientError) | retry_if_exception_type(aiohttp.ClientResponseError)`:
        *   This tells `tenacity` to retry if an `aiohttp.ClientError` (covers connection issues, timeouts before response, etc.) or an `aiohttp.ClientResponseError` (covers HTTP error statuses like 429, 5xx) is raised.
        *   The `|` acts as an OR condition.
        *   You can make this more specific if needed, e.g., by providing a custom function to `retry_if_exception` that checks `e.status == 429`.
    *   `before_sleep=before_sleep_log(self._logger, logging.WARNING)`: This will log a warning message using your existing logger before `tenacity` sleeps for a retry. It includes details about the attempt number and the exception.
    *   `reraise=True`: If all retry attempts fail, `tenacity` will re-raise the last exception. This is important so that `asyncio.gather` in `get_offers` can catch it and log it as an error for that specific task.
3.  **Logging Attempt Number**:
    *   `self._logger.info(f"Requesting VerbynDich page {page} (attempt {self._get_offer.retry.statistics.get('''attempt_number''', 1)})...")`
    *   `tenacity` injects a `retry` object into the decorated function, which has a `statistics` attribute. We use this to log the current attempt number.
4.  **Simplified Error Handling in `_get_offer`**:
    *   The manual `for attempt in range(max_retries):` loop is removed.
    *   The explicit `try...except aiohttp.ClientResponseError/ClientError` blocks for retrying are removed because `tenacity` now handles this.
    *   `response.raise_for_status()` is still crucial. If the response status indicates an error (like 429, 500, etc.), this will raise an `aiohttp.ClientResponseError`, which `tenacity` will then catch and decide whether to retry based on the decorator's configuration.
5.  **Return Value on Failure**:
    *   With `reraise=True`, if all retries fail, `_get_offer` will raise the last exception.
    *   In `get_offers`, `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` will catch this exception. Your existing logic for processing results will then log it.
    *   If you wanted `_get_offer` to return a default value (e.g., `None` or `{}`) on complete failure instead of raising, you would set `reraise=False` and add a `retry_error_callback` to the `@retry` decorator to return your default. However, `reraise=True` is often better for visibility of errors.
6.  **`_get_offer_with_semaphore`**: This method remains largely the same. Its purpose is to limit overall concurrency using the semaphore, while `tenacity` handles retries for individual requests that get through the semaphore.

This setup provides a robust way to handle transient errors and rate limits automatically. Remember to adjust the `stop_after_attempt`, `wait_exponential` parameters, and the `retry` conditions to best suit the API you're working with.

## User Question:

Would circuit breaker also be a valid option for inconsistent api endpoints? What are the beneftis of tenacity?

## GitHub Copilot Answer:

Yes, a **circuit breaker** pattern is also a very valid and often recommended option for dealing with inconsistent or overloaded API endpoints, especially when failures are more persistent.

Let's break down both and their benefits:

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**

*   **What it is:** A circuit breaker acts like an electrical circuit breaker. It monitors for failures when calling an external service.
    *   **Closed State:** Initially, requests are allowed to pass through. If the number of failures in a certain period exceeds a threshold, the circuit "trips" and moves to the **Open** state.
    *   **Open State:** For a configured timeout period, all calls to the service are immediately rejected (or a fallback response is returned) *without* attempting the actual network call. This prevents the application from repeatedly trying an operation that's likely to fail and gives the struggling downstream service time to recover.
    *   **Half-Open State:** After the timeout, the circuit allows a limited number of "test" requests to pass through. If these succeed, the circuit moves back to the **Closed** state. If they fail, it returns to the **Open** state for another timeout period.
*   **Benefits for Inconsistent Endpoints:**
    *   **Prevents Cascading Failures:** Stops your application from overwhelming an already struggling service, which could make the problem worse or impact other parts of your system.
    *   **Fail Fast:** When the circuit is open, your application gets an immediate failure (or fallback) instead of waiting for timeouts on each request to the failing service. This improves responsiveness.
    *   **Resource Protection:** Saves resources (CPU, memory, network sockets) in your application by not attempting calls that are very likely to fail.
    *   **Automatic Recovery:** The half-open state allows the system to automatically detect when the downstream service has recovered.

**Tenacity (Retry Library)**

*   **What it is:** `tenacity` is a library specifically designed to simplify the process of retrying an operation if it fails.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Handles Transient Faults:** Excellent for dealing with temporary issues like:
        *   Brief network glitches.
        *   Temporary server overload (e.g., HTTP 503 Service Unavailable).
        *   Rate limiting (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests), where waiting and retrying is the expected behavior.
    *   **Configurable Retry Strategies:**
        *   **Number of Attempts:** You can define how many times to retry.
        *   **Wait Strategies:** Implements various delays between retries (fixed, exponential backoff, random jitter) to avoid overwhelming the service with immediate retries.
        *   **Conditional Retries:** You can specify which exceptions or conditions should trigger a retry.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Provides a clean, decorator-based API that makes adding retry logic very straightforward.
    *   **Logging:** Integrates well with logging to inform you about retry attempts.
    *   **Asynchronous Support:** Works seamlessly with `asyncio`, which is crucial for your `aiohttp` based code.

**Circuit Breaker vs. Tenacity - How They Relate:**

They are **not mutually exclusive** and often work very well **together**.

*   **Tenacity (Inner Layer):** You can use `tenacity` to handle immediate, transient failures for an individual request. It will try a few times with backoff.
*   **Circuit Breaker (Outer Layer):** If `tenacity` exhausts its retries for several consecutive operations (indicating a more persistent problem), the circuit breaker (monitoring these ultimate failures) can then trip to the "Open" state. This stops even `tenacity` from attempting new calls for a while.

**In your specific case with the VerbynDich API being slow and returning 429s:**

*   **Tenacity is a great first step** (as you've implemented) to handle the 429s by waiting and retrying. This is often the direct requirement for rate-limited APIs.
*   **A circuit breaker could be added on top** if you find that despite `tenacity`'s retries, the VerbynDich API remains unresponsive or continues to rate-limit excessively for a prolonged period. The circuit breaker would then prevent your application from even attempting the `_get_offer` calls (including `tenacity`'s retries) for a while, protecting your system and giving VerbynDich more significant time to recover or for its rate limit window to reset.

**Summary of Tenacity's Benefits:**

1.  **Simplicity:** Easy to add robust retry logic with minimal code.
2.  **Flexibility:** Highly configurable stop conditions, wait strategies, and retry conditions.
3.  **Targeted:** Specifically designed for retrying operations.
4.  **Asynchronous Native:** Works well with `asyncio`.
5.  **Good for Transient Issues & Rate Limits:** Ideal for situations where a retry after a short delay is likely to succeed (like your 429 errors).

You'd consider adding a circuit breaker if the problems are more severe or long-lasting than what simple retries can effectively handle, or if you want to protect your system more broadly from a consistently failing dependency.
